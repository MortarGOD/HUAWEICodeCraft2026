# Optimization Notes

## Confirmed online scoring context

- Baseline score: `1185`
- Baseline total time: `108s`
- Total time limit: `300s` (5 minutes)

## Online dataset characteristics

- Linear: 50 groups. Each group has:
  - 1 weight
  - 5 calibration activations
  - 5 test activations
  - 250 (W, A) test pairings in total across groups.
- Attention: 50 groups. Each group has 5 calibration + 5 test QKV samples.
- Total test tensors: 650.
- Weight size: not smaller than `4k * 4k`.
- Activation sizes: `1*T*4k`, `10*T*4k`, `128*T*4k`, `512*T*4k`,
  `1024*T*4k`; the first dimension values `(1, 10, 128, 512, 1024)` are
  batch/token scales.

## Allowed offline-fitting idea (important)

The contest allows the offline calibration function to:

1. Dequantize the fixed NVFP4 weight `W`.
2. Use calibration activations `A_calib` to compute `Y = A_calib @ W^T`.
3. Fit a HiF4-constrained `Q(W)` (i.e. `weight_params`) by minimizing the
   output error, e.g. `|| A_calib @ W^T - A_calib @ Q(W)^T ||_F^2`.
4. Return that fixed `Q(W)` and the auxiliary `activation_state`.

This is layer-wise/offline weight calibration, similar to GPTQ/HiGPTQ, and it
is not the prohibited online `A @ W`-to-fit-`Q(A)` behavior.

## Next implementation candidates

1. Offline GPTQ-like HiF4 weight optimization using calibration activations.
2. Per-channel SmoothQuant-style scale folding between W and A.
3. Per-64-block optimal discrete scale/E1 search for HiF4.
4. Attention: apply the same Hadamard rotation to Q and K offline/online to
   preserve `Q K^T` while reducing outliers.

## Version history

- `solution_v1.py`: direct-cast baseline.
- `solution_v2.py`: Linear SmoothQuant-style per-channel scale; online inverse
  scale for activations; attention still direct-cast. Local mini-sample Linear
  output MSE improved from ~5.87 to ~5.47.
- `solution_v3.py`: v2 + per-block E6M2 candidate search for weight
  quantization. Local mini-sample Linear output MSE improved to ~5.18.
